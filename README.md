# popcorn
This is a short program I used to analyze sound recordings of popcorn being popped.
It is part of a small experiment for a first-year university course on scientific reporting.
The goal of the experiment was to determine whether or not the sound of popcorn being popped can be interpretted as a representation of a normal distribution.
Considering the scope of the experiment and the resources at hand, the results seem to offer enough evidence that this is indeed the case.
