# popcorn
This is a short program I used to analyze recordings of popcorn being popped.
It is part of a small experiment for a first-year university course on scientific reporting.
The goal of the experiment was to determine wether or not the sound of popcorn being popped can be interpretted as a representation of a normal distribution.
The results seem to offer enough evidence that this indeed the case, considering the scope of the experiment and the resources at hand.
